Design District Raleigh
A Guide to Shopping and Dining in Raleigh’s Design District.
Please support and patronize our local Raleigh businesses. These retail design stores have lots to offer from an eclectic array of antiques to gift giving ideas to fabulous accessories for the home and everything in-between. Several businesses also offer custom painting and repair for furniture and lighting. Please read the business descriptions if you are looking for something specific, otherwise roam around our district and enjoy all that it offers. If you're hungry, we've got that covered too... eleven venues, offering a variety of fare, are also on the map. Thank you for visiting and shopping local.
WHERE TO FIND MAP
In addition to finding the map at all the participating retail locations and restaurants, you may also pick up a copy here:……
I have a list that Steven works from for distribution but not sure that everyone always “accepts” the maps. So, once he is done distribution end of next week, I will have updated, accurate list to include.   Just names and addresses of these locations because I don’t think we need to link to their websites as we aren’t advertising for them (it is hotels, visitor center, museums, etc).

LINKS FOR NEW BUSINESSES:
I have updated the website with links to new folks, so you can just alter from there. You will be amazed at how many don’t have websites – WHAAT?  Anyway, I link to their social media of choice.
COPY OF LISTINGS:
This is the document I gave to graphic designer, Design District Verbiage.  Will attach to Google Docs.
PHOTOS:
Steven is uploading PicStitch photos of new participants to the DropBox.


Bababada...that’s all folks!   Let me know what else you need.  Excited for you to work your magic with my little community enterprise!
